**Note**

This will be a hands-on session - the students will benefit from trying to run the material we discuss. As such, students should come prepared, having downloaded and installed Python and the necessary libraries a priori (I can offer technical support as needed, but this is not the best use of time). The easiest way to do this is to go [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), and click the green "Download" button for Python 3.7. 

Note the above link leads to a download of the Anaconda Python distribution, which provides Python + a whole lot of third-party libraries and othertools. Students do not have to get Python this way - this just provides an all-in-one download. These notebooks can be run with the following installed:
- Python 3.6+
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`
- `matplotlib`
- `ipython`
- `jupyter`
- `requests`
