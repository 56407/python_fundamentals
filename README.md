# python_fundamentals
- Python seminar given at Fordham University on December 8th, 2018

**Overview**

Students will learn Python fundamentals, working through basic computer science concepts, practical exercises, and data- and analysis-oriented programming.

The session will be divided into two parts, with the first serving as an "Intro to Programming, with Python" sort of class, and the second as an introduction to the NumPy and Pandas libraries, key tools for any analytical Python programmer. Part 2 will end with a quick look at scikit-learn, a widely-used machine library.

Each part will run approximately two hours, with a 15-minute break in between, and will include lecturing, interactive programming, and Q&A. This will be a fast-paced session; the hope is that the session will provide exposure to relevant, foundational concepts that students can continue to explore outside of the session.

**Instructor Bio**

Abe Lerman is the Lead Data Scientist for Contently, a SoHo-based technology company focused on corporate branding. He has spent the last year or so as a Python and Data Science Consultant in the Financial Services industry, contracting at Elliott Management and The Blackstone Group. Prior to that, he worked as a Data Scientist in the ad-tech space. He earned a Master of Science degree in Quantitative Finance from Fordham University, and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics from Skidmore College.

**Seminar Details**

Part 1: Python Basics

- Variables and operators
- Iterables
- Flow control
- Functions
- Classes

Part 2:  Analytical Python

- NumPy: arrays, vectorized calculations
- Pandas: DataFrames, built-in methods
- A quick look at scikit-learn

**Note**

This will be a hands-on session - the students will benefit from trying to run the material we discuss. As such, students should come prepared, having downloaded and installed Python and the necessary libraries a priori (I can offer technical support as needed, but this is not the best use of time). The easiest way to do this is to go [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), and click the green "Download" button for Python 3.7. 

Note the above link leads to a download of the Anaconda Python distribution, which provides Python + a whole lot of third-party libraries and othertools. Students do not have to get Python this way - this just provides an all-in-one download. These notebooks can be run with the following installed:
- Python 3.6+
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`
- `jupyter`
